### What Is This?
This application downloads a mission file (for ArmA 3 game) and puts the file into the appropriate folder. GTA Mission Downloader greatly reduces the time that it takes to download the aforementioned file when it is compared to the time that it takes while in-game. The app also has the functionality to add any ArmA 3/TeamSpeak 3 server.
